# British Airways Customer Booking Prediction

## About

This repository contains a predictive modeling project developed during a virtual internship program with Forage. The project focuses on predicting customer bookings using real data from British Airways.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a customer's booking with British Airways will be completed or not. The dataset used for this project includes various features related to the booking process, such as sales channel, trip type, purchase lead time, flight details, and customer preferences.

## Contents

- [`ba_task_2.ipynb`](ba_task_2.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- [`customer_booking.csv`](customer_booking.csv): Dataset containing the customer booking data from British Airways.
- [`key_insights_task2_BA.pdf`](key_insights_task2_BA.pdf): PDF document containing key insights and findings from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebook (`ba_task_2.ipynb`) to understand the steps taken in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Acknowledgments
